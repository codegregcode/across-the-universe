# Across the Universe

### Description

A game where you create a universe, with galaxies, solar systems, planets and possibly even life!

### Installation

Navigate to where you want to install the repo and type

`git clone https://github.com/codegregcode/across-the-universe`

You will need to install Jest using NPM if you'd like to make any changes (if you want to make changes fork this repo, and copy that url instead of cloning this one)

`npm install jest`

### Roadmap

There's no real timeline with this project, I'm just going to work on it in the downtime of my CommandShift studies.

At the moment, functionality is very limited...the universe will create a random number of galaxies, but no solarsystems and planets etc.

Also, instead of totally random number of galaxies being created, I'd like that number to be influenced by the user interacting with 'something' (e.g. clicks of a button during a timed event). The interaction will determine how many galaxies, solar systems and planets are made, as well as increasing posibilty for life. Life is 'created' by a solar system having a seed of life and planet a chance of life
